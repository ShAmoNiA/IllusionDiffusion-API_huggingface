## Illusion Diffusion Readme

This script utilizes the Illusion Diffusion API provided by Hugging Face to apply various effects to images. The API allows users to manipulate images based on provided prompts and parameters. Below is a breakdown of the script's functionality:

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

### Usage
1. **Upload Image**: The script begins by uploading an image (`portrait-of-scarlet-macaw.jpg`) to the Illusion Diffusion API.
2. **Apply Illusion Effect**: After uploading the image, it prompts the API to make the bird in the image appear as an illusion. The Illusion Diffusion API then processes the image based on the prompt and provided parameters.
3. **Join Image Processing Queue**: The script adds the processed image to a processing queue for further adjustments. It provides additional prompts and parameters for the processing queue.
4. **Retrieve Processed Image**: Upon completion of processing, the script retrieves the processed image from the API.

### Steps
1. **Image Upload**: Uploads the image to the Illusion Diffusion API.
2. **Apply Illusion Effect**: Applies an illusion effect to the uploaded image based on a specified prompt.
3. **Join Processing Queue**: Adds the processed image to a processing queue for further adjustments.
4. **Retrieve Processed Image**: Retrieves the processed image after completion of processing.

### Usage Guide
- Ensure the script is run in an environment with Python installed.
- Install the `requests` library if not already installed (`pip install requests`).
- Replace the `portrait-of-scarlet-macaw.jpg` with your desired image.
- Execute the script, and the processed image will be saved as `image.png` in the working directory.

### Note
- Make sure to replace the provided image with your own image path.
- Adjust the prompts and parameters according to your requirements for image processing.
